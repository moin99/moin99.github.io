<h1>Wireless Infrared Communication</h1>
<section>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
		Wireless infrared communications refers to the use of free-space propagation of light waves in the near infrared band as a transmission medium for communication. The communication can be between one portable communication device and another or between a portable device and a tethered device, called an access point or base station. Typical portable devices include laptop computers, personal digital assistants, and portable telephones, while the base stations are usually connected to a computer with other networked connections. Typically, Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are used as transmitters while photodiodes are used as receivers. In cases where high directionality is required, laser diodes are used as transmitters. IR communication link can be point to point or diffuse type.

	<h3>Point to Point</h3>
	<p>
		The simplest link type is the point-to-point system. There, the transmitter and receiver must be pointed at each other to establish a link. The line-of-sight (LOS) path from the transmitter to the receiver must be clear of obstructions, and most of the transmitted light is directed toward the receiver. Hence, point-to-point systems are also called directed LOS systems. The links can be temporarily created for a data exchange session between two users, or established more permanently by aiming a mobile unit at a base station unit in the LAN replacement application.

	<h3>Diffuse</h3>
	<p>
		In diffuse systems, the link is always maintained between any transmitter and any receiver in the same vicinity by reflecting or “bouncing” the transmitted information-bearing light off reflecting surfaces such as ceilings, walls, and furniture. Here, the transmitter and receiver are non-directed; the transmitter employs a wide transmit beam and the receiver has a wide field-of-view. Also, the LOS path is not required. Hence, diffuse systems are also called non-directed non-LOS systems. These systems are well suited to the wireless communication between microcontrollers, freeing the user from knowing and aligning with the locations of the other microcontroller.
